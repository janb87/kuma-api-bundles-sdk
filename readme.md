# Kunstmaan Api bundles frontend poc

Poc around the Kunstmaan Api bundles.

Consists out of:

1. A script to generate Typescript declartions out of the api
2. A client side SDK which can be used both in a browser as node.js
3. Example static site build with react-static

Still to do:

1. Generator for page types (from api our yaml file)
2. Generator for regions (derived from page tpes)
3. Generator for page parts
4. Generator for routes (get all slugs from page tree)
5. Custom react-static template for kunstmaan bundles
